This a repository collecting shiny apps I have been generating

a) VC_explorer v1 is not completed. Synthea generated patients/control cohort with breast cancer data.

b) VCExplorer_CT is somewhat working. A combination of labor generated data merged with RR data and derivatives thereof from probands wearables. 

c) Vindex2 is very similar to VCExplorer_CT but is working. There are no wearables data involved. Anyway, seems to be more like a beta version.
